    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      The first thing I would tell my client is to get everyone in the team
      involved from the start. Make web security a top priority in every step of
      the project from the beginning, and set up a cybersecurity framework where
      you research security risks and make a response plan in the case of an
      attack happening. Make sure all the software developers understand things
      like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site resource
      forgery (CSRF) and how to best prevent them. Setting up automated
      processes to scan for vulnerabilities in code and removes human errors
      like forgetting to scan an app or website before release and catches
      things early on. I would also advise them to be proactive and use several
      security measures. For example, instead of waiting for an attack to
      happen, performing a mock attack to see how well your team and website is
      protected is a good way to be prepared, should the real thing ever occur.
      In closing I would tell them that dealing with web security is never a job
      that is «done». New threats will always appear so its important to keep up
      to date on whats new and the best ways to stay protected.
